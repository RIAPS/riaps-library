Welcome to the RIAPS GPIO Device Testing Page

The current testing applications are:
* GpioDeviceAppExample
    - This test shows how to interface with the GPIO Device component from another RIAPS component
    - Application and Device Components are both Python code
    - GPIO on Expansion Pin (P8) is used


The Reusable Device Component code is located in GpioPyDevice.  An example application using this component is under riaps-library/ModbusTesting/ModbusUartGpioIndicatorApp.
